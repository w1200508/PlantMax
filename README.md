# PlantMax
In order to explore how to visualize plant signals, I designed PlantMax, an interesting interactive interface for plant music. It combines the Galvanic Skin Response sensor with capacitive sensors to take data from plants, which are then processed by a program made by software Max/ Msp and converted into music that can be sensed by the human ear. Through the interaction between humans and the interface, it realized the “dialogue” between humans and plants.  In the project, I uploaded programs for Arduino Mega2560 and Max/ MSP.
